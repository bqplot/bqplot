## Conforming with linters

This projects uses both [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) and the plugin that creates the integration between both, [eslint-plugin-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier) to lint its code.

Currently there has been an active effort on making the project comply to all eslint rules so the eslint rules are currently not enforced.

Prettier rules are enforced though and you can run them in the `js` folder with:

```bash
    yarn prettier --write . 
```

The configuration of this project linters were based in the [widgets-cookiecutter](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/widget-ts-cookiecutter/tree/master/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.github_project_name%7D%7D).
