    "Details on how to use the fast interval selector can be found in [this](../Interactions/Selectors.ipynb#fastintervalselector) notebook. In this tutorial notebook, we will look at linking plots using the fast interval selector. Interval selectors are ideally suited for time series analysis where we want to perform statistical computations on different time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating an interval selector we need pass in the x scale. We can additionally pass in the marks on which the interval selector operates. When the interval selector moves, it updates the following traits (on which callbacks can be registered)\n",
    "* `selected` trait of the interval selector object itself. This trait contains the start and end of the x axis obtained from the x scale. Note that these values may not be present in the `x` attribute of the marks!\n",
    "* `selected` trait of the marks on which the selector operates. This trait contains *all* the *indices* of the line.x which are spanned by the interval selector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recipe for linking plots is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an interval selector object by passing in the X-scale and marks on which the selector should operate on (optional)\n",
    "2. Pass it to the figure through the `interaction` argument\n",
    "3. Register a callback (which potentially updates other plots) on either the `selected` attribute of the interval selector object or `selected` attribute of the marks objects in the figure\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>`FastIntervalSelector` updates the `selected` trait **continuously**. Therefore, registering computationally intensive callbacks is *not* recommended with `FastIntervalSelector`\n",
