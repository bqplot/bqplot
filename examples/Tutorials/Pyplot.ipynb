    "`pyplot` is a context based functional API offering meaningful defaults. It's a concise API and very similar to matplotlib's pyplot. Users new to `bqplot` should use `pyplot` as a starting point. Users create figure and mark objects using `pyplot` functions.\n",

    "Steps for building plots in `pyplot`:\n",
    "1. Create a figure object using plt.figure()\n",
    "* (Optional steps)\n",
    "    * Scales can be customized using `plt.scales` function\n",
    "    * Axes options can customized by passing a dict to `axes_options` argument in the marks' functions\n",
    "* Create marks using `pyplot` functions like `plot`, `bar`, `scatter` etc. (All the marks created will be automatically added to the figure object created in step 1)\n",
    "* Render the figure object using the following approaches:\n",
    "    * Using `plt.show` function which renders the figure in the current context along with toolbar for panzoom etc.\n",
    "    * Using display on the figure object created in step 1 (toolbar doesn't show up in this case)\n",
    "\n",
    "`pyplot` also offers many helper functions. A few are listed here:\n",
    "* plt.xlim: sets the domain bounds of the current 'x' scale\n",
    "* plt.ylim: sets the domain bounds of the current 'y' scale\n",
    "* plt.grids: shows/hides the axis grid lines\n",
    "* plt.xlabel: sets the X-Axis label\n",
    "* plt.ylabel: sets the Y-Axis label\n",
    "* plt.hline: draws a horizontal line at a specified level\n",
    "* plt.vline: draws a vertical line at a specified level\n",
